Thristy

Simplicity

While the appearance of your website is certainly important, most people aren't coming to your site to evaluate how slick the design is. They want to complete some action or to find some specific piece of information. The colour used is very precisely so that it matches with the user experience and the purpose of the website too. The typefaces are highly readable, so nothing too artsy or very minimal script fonts.


1 Visulal hierarchy

Visual Hierarchy: Closely tied to the principle of simplicity, visual hierarchy means arranging and organising website elements so that visitors naturally gravitate toward the most important elements first. When it comes to optimising for usability and user experience , the goal is to lead visitors to complete a desired action but in a way that feels natural and enjoyable. By adjusting the position, color, or size of certain elements, I have structured our site in such a way that viewers will be drawn to those elements first.

2 Navigability

Planning out intuitive navigation on your site is crucial to helping visitors find what they're looking for. Ideally, a visitor should land on a website and not have to think extensively about where to click next. Moving from point A to point B should be as frictionless as possible. 
I have kept the structure of primary navigation simple. 
i have included navigation in the footer of our website. 
Include links within our page copy, and make it clear where those links go.

3 Consistency

In addition to keeping our navigation consistent, the overall look and feel of our site should be similar across all of your site's pages. Backgrounds, colour schemes, typefaces, and even the tone of our writing are all areas where consistency has a positive impact on usability and user experience. Not each and every page has the same layout for specific types of pages.

4 Responsivity

To provide a truly great user experience, our site has to be compatible with the many different devices that your visitors are using. Responsive design means investing in a highly flexible website structure. On a responsive site, content is automatically resized and reshuffled to fit the dimensions of whichever device a visitor happens to be using.


5 Accessibility

The goal of our website is accessibility. To make a website that anyone can use, including people with disabilities or limitations that affect their browsing experience. On our website, the visitors are aware of the content because it is in simple English and easy to understand. The website is robust across different assistive technologies,devices,and browsers.


6 Conventionality

While making our website, the most challenging part is balancing originality with your expectations. Most of us are expert internet users, and there are specific conventions we've grown accustomed to over time. It includes placing the main navigation at the top of the page and placing a logo at the top left of the page. 
I always make a logo clickable, so it always brings a visitor back to the homepage. On our website, the buttons have links as well, and while you hover over them, they change the color/appearance.


7: Make use of white space to separate text and other elements.

Whitespace refers to the negative areas in any composition. Whitespace provides users with visual breaks as they process a website’s design or content, which is not only aesthetically pleasing. By minimising distractions, whitespace makes it easier for users to focus, process information, and understand what it’s important. Our website relies on proper white 10 on 10 scaling.

8 added images to engage and inform readers.

The balance between text and images is essential on a website. Incorporating visuals makes our content more informative, engaging, and memorable. 80% of people remember what they saw rather than what they read. So it's easier for some people to learn and process information visually.

9 Our CTAs stand out.

The call to action should be prominent on any website so that we can convert visitors into customers in just a few steps.With the help of the right images and font, the call to action is clear, as it converts the normal user into our regular customer.

10 Examples of Micro Animation

The animation, which takes a lot more time, sometimes creates user boredom because the user wants a product and he came here to buy a product. So that's why our website uses some micro animation. Most of the time, using the best experience of any website can be best when the micro-animation adds to that, micro-animation with optimal effects.
